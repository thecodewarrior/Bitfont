- `Unifont-*-(fixed-advance).bitfont` is identical to the pure version except it has each glyph image cropped to its bounds
- `Unifont-*-(auto-advance).bitfont` is identical to the fixed-advance version except it has the fixed 9 or 17 pixel advance removed so Bitfont's automatic advance algorithm can apply.
