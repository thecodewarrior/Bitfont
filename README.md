# Bitfont
A bitmap font file format, typesetter, and text editor backend.

The typesetter and text editor system will be based almost entirely on the documentation of Apple's mature [Cocoa Text Architecture](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/TextFonts/Conceptual/CocoaTextArchitecture/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009459-CH1-SW1).
